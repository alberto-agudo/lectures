When you are using nested loops (one loop inside the other) or more complicated control flow you may choose to have more explanatory temporary names.\n",

    "The ```SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing``` error occurs when the end of your source code is reached before all code is executed. This happens when you make a mistake in the structure, or syntax, of your code. EOF stands for End of File. This represents the last character in a Python program.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### IndentationError\n",
    "The cause of the ```IndentationError: unexpected indent``` error is indenting your code too far, or using too many tabs and spaces to indent a line of code. The other indentation errors you may encounter are: Unindent does not match any other indentation level. Expected an indented block.\n",
